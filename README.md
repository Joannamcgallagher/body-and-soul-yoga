# Body and Soul Yoga

This is a website created for users of  all levels of fitness and abilities, to research different types of yoga offered, tutorials on each and a form to sign up for more information. Users will be able to try out the different types of yoga and determine which they would prefer. The target audience here is very broad as yoga is such a popular workout and can be done by anyone regardless of age or fitness ability.

## Features

- ### Navigation Bar
     * This is featured across all four pages and provides clickable links to the Homepage, Types of Yoga, Tutorials and Sign up page which prevents the user from clicking the browsers back button.
     * This is a fully responsive navigation bar and is consistently styled across all pages.

- ### Landing page image
    * The landing page image is that of a woman practicing Yoga at sunset which goes with the theme of the website. It's soft tones is calming yet eyecatching.
    * There is also a quote, credit is stated under the quote, which adds to the ambiance of the page and website.

    * There is similar images and quotes across the four pages, each containing a variety of someone practicing a yoga pose with the sunset in the background and a thoughful and relevant quote on each image.

- ### About us and benefits of yoga sections
    * Here the user can read a bit about those behind the page and find out what the page is all about. It's short yet decriptive.
    * The benefits are listed here in an unordered list which can motivate and encourage the user to try a yoga tutorial or class.

- ### Social media links
    * These are contained in the footer and are consisent throughout the entire site. 
    * There are five links to social media sites; Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Youtube and TikTok.
    * Each of the links when clicked will open up the link in a new tab to prevent the user from 
    having to use the browsers navigation to return to the website.

- ### Types of Yoga
    * This displays the different types of Yoga and a short description of each with a view to inform the user of the difference between them.
    * They are diaplyed across the page which is readable to the user and the font and border colours are the same and flows naturally throughout.

- ### Tutorials
    * Here the user has the choice of 6 tutorials. There is one for each of the types in the previous page to keep in with the flow of the website. 
    * The tutorials are all Youtube links and give the user full control of playback and whether they maximise the screen or watch on the default size provided.

- ### Sign up form
    * The user is presented a form here that they can enter in their name and email address in order to sign up and receive further communications.
    * The form is style using the same colours and fonts to give the site a natural flow and not be too visually demanding. 
    * The sign up button has a hover effect so when the user hovers over this, the background and foreground colors switch to give the use a sense of feedback.

- ### Features left to implement
    * A list of classes with details such as times and location and allow the user to be able to book a space online and send a confirmation email back to the client.
    * I think a gallery page here would fit in quite nicely and display the various types of yoga mentioned earlier.
