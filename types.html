        <h2>Types of Yoga</h2>
        <div>
            <h3>Vinyasa</h3>
            <p>
                <br>
                A Vinyasa yoga class is when poses flow from one to the next without the teacher stopping to explain the finer points of each pose. This means 
                that you come away with a good workout as well as a yoga experience.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Bikram</h3>
            <p>
                <br>
                The Bikram yoga class entails a total of 26 yoga poses that are designed to stretch and strengthen the muscles as well as compress and rinse the
                organs of the body. The poses are usually done in a heated room to facilitate the release of toxins.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Kundalini</h3>
            <p>
                <br>
                Kundalini yoga practice is equal parts spiritual and physical. This style is all about releasing the kundalini energy in your body said to be trapped, 
                or coiled, in the lower spine.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Yin</h3>
            <p>
                <br>
                Yin yoga focuses on passive, seated postures that target the tissues in the hips, pelvis and lower spine. It's ideal for atheltic types who need to
                release tension in joints or to just relax.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Hot</h3>
            <p>
                <br>
                Hot yoga usually takes place in a room heated up to 38 degrees. This helps the body to prepare for movement and to remove impurities. This helps the 
                body to de-stress, giving you an intense workout and improves your strength and flexibility.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Chair</h3>
            <p>
                <br>
                Chair yoga is an adapted form of yoga for those who may have difficulty standing or moving easily from a standing to seated pose. It's great for those
                who need more support, those managing an injury or who want a more theraputic approach.
